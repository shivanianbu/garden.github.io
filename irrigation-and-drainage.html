If your house sits on a huge lot, and you're not sure if you can afford to landscape the entire area, talk to your professional landscaper about the possibility of landscaping it in sections. Xeriscaping is a style of landscaping that utilizes plants, shrubs, ground covers and rocks that need very little water to thrive. The cost of installing a xeriscaped yard is often more than simply planting grass and flowers. However, once established the maintenance and water costs are kept low by design. A professional landscaper and gardener will be able to tell you the best approach for this. For example, if there are plants that take a longer time to come to maturity you may be able to plant them first and when they are reaching their peak landscape </p>
